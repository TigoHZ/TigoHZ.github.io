    <p>I chose ICT because I love technology and I want to understand the ins and outs of it.</p>
    <p>I have, however, never tried coding because that looked too complex for me to learn on my own</p>
    <p>Now that I have been going to ICT school for a bit I feel it's easier than i thought</p>
    <p>I'm not saying it's going to stay this easy because I feel like it's only going to</p>
    <p>get harder. It feels like I'm just at the tip of the iceberg and that a lot more challenges are coming my way</p>
