      <h2>Motivate you choice</h2>
      <p>I chose the ICT study because I love technology in general</p>
      <p>I see ICT as very future proof because we are still on the rise of tech</p>
      <p>I feel that ICT will be a very sought after job so I think it will be easy to find work</p>
      <p>Also, my dream job would be Game Developer and an ICT study would be the gateway into that world</p>

      <h2>Study choice activities</h2>
      <p>I went to 4 Open Days, including to the HZ twice.</p>
      <p>I also went to fontys and I enjoyed it there but getting a house would turn out ot be a big problem</p>
      <p>Middelburg is a lot closer to home and doable with the bus, that's why I chose HZ</p>

    <div class="lownotcenter">
      <h2>After the study</h2>
      <p>After I am done with my study here I want to dive into the game business</p>
      <p>Gaming is my biggest hobby and I want to contribute back to the industry that gives me joy</p>
      <p>I don't know for wich company I want to work for yet, but I hope to know after I am done with the study.</p>
