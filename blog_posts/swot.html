      <h3>Strengths</h3>
      <p>I personally think that I am easy going and open minded</p>
      <p>I can get my work done when I need to, even if it's a close call sometimes</p>
      <p>When I start working on something, I usually finish it before taking a break</p>
    </div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left:850px;top:200px" class="blog">
      <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      <p>I'm extremely clumsy, I often drop my stuff on the ground</p>
      <p>and I also injure myself every now and then</p>
      <p>I do buy extra sturdy stuff though, so I rarely break anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="position: absolute; left:250px;top:500px" class="blog">
      <h3>Opportunities</h3>
      <p>I hope that I'm able to secure a job in the game industry</p>
      <p>because that is my dream job. But i wouldn't mind anything in ICT</p>
      <p>I hope that one day I can make a game that lots of people like</p>

      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <p>I fear that I will miss the bus sometimes wich would</p>
      <p>cause me to miss some lecture time.</p>
      <p>The bus from Hulst to Middelburg is something to cry about</p>
