   <h1>My motivations for ICT</h1>
    <p>I want to follow the ICT course because it is the gateway to game developer.</p>
    <p>I want to become a game developer because games are my passion and my biggest hobby.
    </p>
    <p>I'm very interested in how games are made and I want to contribute to
    </p>
    <p>the game industry by becoming a developer and helping to make games.</p>
    <p>Besides games I'm just in general a tech nut and love the possibilities that come with technology</p>
  </div>
  <div class="arguments">
    <h2>Why I'm motivated</h2>
    <p>ICT is the perfect study for me because It's about something that truly interests me,</p>
    <p>and I enjoy learning about stuff that interests me.</p>
    <p>I'm a big gamer, I got my first console when I was 6</p>
    <p>so I believe I have a good understanding of what makes a game good and what makes it bad.</p>
    <p>That's why I think I could become a succesfull game developer</p>
